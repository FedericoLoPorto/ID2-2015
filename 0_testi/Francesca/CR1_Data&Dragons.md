# Data & Dragons

###What is it?

####Description from the autor

"Data & Dragons Level 1-3" is an evolving sculpture project which has already been shown in several art shows around the world.
The first time the sculpture has taken shape was in Austria, in 2013. 
At the moment, the workpiece is composed by three installation: the first two under the name **"Kilohydra: A Love Letter to Chelsea and xxxx.xxx "** and the third is **"Cloud Farming"**. Each of them dialogue with data collected from the internet, but in diffent ways.

**Data and Dragons: Kilohydra**, 2014, custom designed PCB boards, ethernet patch cables, 80/20 aluminum installation: 75 x 23.75 x 20 in / 190.5 x 60.3 x 50.8 cm,  Photo by John Berens for bitforms gallery, New York City, United States

Kalohydra, as we can see from the photos, resembles a series of servers but, more precisely, _is a series of custom printed circuit boards that intercept and log data from its surrounding_. Connected by Ethernet cables, Kilohydra anthropomorphizes a server room, a eulogy to a time where the online experience was anonymous and unknown. Information is processed but the sculpture never shares its findings.

**Data and Dragons: Cloud Farming**, 2014 custom designed printed circuit boards, ethernet patch cables, 80/20 aluminum installation: 31 x 87 x 35 in / 78.7 x 221 x 88.9 cm, Photo by John Berens for bitforms gallery, New York City, United States

Cloud Farming _questions the sacred nature of technology by re-contextualizing system hierarchy as a portrait of data_. It manifests the cloud, social networks, data, leaks and what forms social capital into a single object. Ultimately its a creative experiment about contemporary power structures as a type of group consciousness, becoming a 3-dimensional map of post-Wikileaks information culture.

####How I see it

_The title_, in my humble opinion, might come from two inspirations:
*Dragon Data: was a Welsh producer of home computers during the early 1980s
*Dungeons & Dragons: the fantasy role playboard

As the artist stated, the workpiece deals with the digital world around us. It explores it from a communication point of view, the server collects data from the what is around but it doesn't share it and no one can access them. I feel like this is a _smart opposition_ to the omnipresence of data collected everyday, most of them are useless or relatively significant because they are accessible anytime, anywhere. What makes the data collected from this  server is that they're secret as our identity should totally or, at least, partially be on the net. And this is the other speculation she does over her  works. 

The _Ethernet wires_ are extremely long and fall down the floor in a decadent, disorderd way, but still harmonius. The choice of black, instead of grey, has a strong meaning and suggest a dark matter, which enhance the myster around this piece and the data it collects.

It is a _portrait of the future_. Technologies will be self-referenced and will acquire information no matter what and mankind can't access them.

Or maybe, it a wish for more privacy for the web users, a secret hope to create a safe  to maintein our personal data.
