#Chaotic Flow

by Illutron

###What is it?

####Description from the author

Using water pumps, compressed air and 1000 meters of PVC tubing we designed a sculpture that simulates the flow of
bike traffic through the streets and pathways Copenhagen. Presenting the real data in an abstract form.
The sculpture was commissioned by the organizers of the 4S/EASST which has taken place in Copenhagen in 2012.

The EASST is the European Association for the Study of Science and Technology and that year the theme of the Conference
was the Copenhagenization phenomenon: the status a city acquires as a site for experimental design,
green city development and bicycling, first developed when a part of Broadway, in Manhattan was turned into a bike path.
The participants were from many different countries, so the organizers wanted to create a warm environement throwing
the city in the conference. That's why, they asked Illutron an installation for the reception hall which
would relate to Copenhagen being an extraordinary good city for biking.

The starting point was the interest that NOME TIPO has always had towards fractals and chaotic systems, their
mathematical unpredictable results and the inner beauty of their rapresentations.
