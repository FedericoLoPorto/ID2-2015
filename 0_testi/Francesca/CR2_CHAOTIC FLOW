#Chaotic Flow

###What is it?

####Description from the author

Using water pumps, compressed air and 1000 meters of PVC tubing we designed a sculpture that simulates the flow of
bike traffic through the streets and pathways Copenhagen. Presenting the real data in an abstract form.
The sculpture was commissioned by the organizers of the 4S/EASST which has taken place in Copenhagen in 2012.

The EASST is the European Association for the Study of Science and Technology and that year the theme of the Conference
was the Copenhagenization phenomenon: the status a city acquires as a site for experimental design,
green city development and bicycling, first developed when a part of Broadway, in Manhattan was turned into a bike path.
The participants were from many different countries, so the organizers wanted to create a warm environement throwing
the city in the conference. That's why they asked Illutron, an installation for the reception hall which
would relate to Copenhagen being an extraordinary good city for biking.

The starting point was the interest that Tobias Lukassen has always had towards fractals and chaotic systems, their
mathematical unpredictable results and the aestethic beauty of their rapresentations related to the city development.

They had access to the city database and took the dataset on bikes and their numbers.
Colored liquids flows through transparent tubes, representing the flow of the bikes in the city, bringing the dataset 
back to the physic realm. 
The installation was not only visual but also sounded with registration of mechanical parts of a moving bycicle
tooken by the authors themselves. Those sounds were aubible with headphones put under the installation.
The real deal was competing with daylight because they used lots of colors which were difficult to show in a proper way 
in the place chosen for the installation. In a upper part of the hall, they had the control center, with the liquid tanks, 
computers and controllers. The installation was made by 10 trianle wood structures hung on the ceiling with wires, 
which held the tubes an
All this stuff where put toghether in a system thanks to Arduino. The complete code is accessible at
