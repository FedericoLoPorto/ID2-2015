####Description by the author

Using water pumps, compressed air and 1000 meters of PVC tubing we designed a sculpture that simulates the flow of
bike traffic through the streets and pathways Copenhagen. Presenting the real data in an abstract form.
The sculpture was commissioned by the organizers of the 4S/EASST which has taken place in Copenhagen in 2012.

####Context

The EASST is the European Association for the Study of Science and Technology and that year the theme of the Conference
was the Copenhagenization phenomenon: the status a city acquires as a site for experimental design,
green city development and bicycling, first developed when a part of Broadway, in Manhattan was turned into a bike path.
The participants were from many different countries, so the organizers wanted to create a warm environement throwing
the city in the conference. That's why they asked Illutron, an installation for the reception hall which
would relate to Copenhagen being an extraordinary good city for biking.

####What is, actually.

The installation was made by 10 trianle wood structures hung on the ceiling with wires,
the triangle frames hold the tubes and let them show how liquids flows trough.
They had access to the city database and took the dataset on bikes and their numbers.
Colored liquids flows through transparent tubes, representing the flow of the bikes in the city, bringing the dataset
back to the physic realm.
The installation was not only visual but also sounded with registration of mechanical parts of a moving bycicle
tooken by the authors themselves. Those sounds were aubible with headphones put under the installation.


###How it works
The real deal was competing with daylight because, in the place chosen for the installation,transparent liquids were
not easy to show from distance.
So they came up with the choice of using lots of colors which were easier to show in a proper way and
represented bike fluxes better.
In the second storey of the hall, they had the control center with the liquid tanks, computers and controllers.

Physically, the liquids were pushed at different times by controlled pumps.
The headphones were connected to the central system and they played an edited sequence of sounds.
They converted the statistical dataset in an abstract simulation with python and c++ with openframeworks.
All this stuff was put together in a system thanks to Arduino. The complete code is accessible at

Quoting from [the coder site!] (http://johan.cc/2012/12/28/chaotic-flow/):
_"The technical system behind the installation consists of a set of python scripts for converting the raw data
that we received in a set of similarly (as in not identically) formatted .xlsx files. The scripts imports the data
to a mongodb database, does geocode lookups and a thin python server written using flask and pymongo returns
the data as json.The auditive element of the installation is a maxMSP patch that mixes recordings of traffic and
mechanical sounds from bike parts according to the current amount of traffic in the simulation that it receives over
OSC from openframeworks. An openframeworks application runs the actual simulation. It maps paths through the city to
paths through the sculpture. Three arduino boards control the pumps, air pressure regulators and magnetic
valves for the eight individual channels in the installation."_

Team of developers Domestic Data Streamers created a real-time physical visualization of votes for a graphic design
contest. A person can vote for a specific piece by sending a tweet, after which the machine releases a drop of yellow
liquid and sends it to the corresponding test tube.

###About the artists

Illutron has a bunch of members and it's a collaborative interactive arts studio.
"_Illutron creates large scale interactive art, intriguing explorations into the realm where art and technology meet,
experiments in the water and is a place for individual or collaborative work_"
This is their headquarter

Their artistical research deals many factors and media, such as the city and the relationship with data from the
traffic shown with lights or connecting people and makes them mingle with fun; another path is the interaction between
mankind and machines, sometimes in a funny way, others in a more dramatic way. The media is mostly tangible with an
actual interaction, a concrete one.

###What it means

"_Usually you only relate to this kind of data in a quantitative way. We wanted to create an abstract representation
of the data that conveys something about how the system behind the data works creating a new kind of relation to
the data set and perhaps inspiring new ways to think of it.
The spatial structure is modelled with inspiration from strange attractors and represent the often chaotic nature
of how cities and their infrastructure develop. The fractal that it is modelled after was generated using this script."_

####Source of inspiration

The starting point was the interest that Tobias Lukassen has always had towards fractals and chaotic systems, their
mathematical unpredictable results and the aestethic beauty of their rapresentations related to the city development.
Here an [explanation for fractal:!] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal)

###What it could mean (how i see it)

Why triangles? This is the first question had come to my mind, just because the other components of the installation
are almost fully charge of clear meaning, in my opinion. Well, the answer might be they've chosen triangles to
represent the main pattern of the city from the satellite, but google map discouraged this option. The triangle are all
of the same dimension and isosceles, with the sides lengthened beyond the vertex and this, to me, represents a traffic
cross. Putting the thougths together...the wood frame might be the main roads and tubes are clearly the paths bykes can
follow across the city... the fluxes of bikes flows while the frame are stricly stacked, as the cars are. The tubes overcome
the single frame and I give to this the this meaning: with a bike you can go everywhere and it gives you freedom of
moving wherever you want while whit a car you are ruled in frames. This can also explain the diffent heights of the frames.
The dataset is clearly represented in a not so abstact way if someone explains to you the installation, I mean the flow
of bikes is preserved and valuated by given them a specific road, as Copenhagen does.


###What if

The only what if? and this step is: what if they had construct the installation in a more pleacent way, I know it's about
chaotic theories but, as the artist stated, even in the chaos there's beauty, which to me is harmony. A thing that this
installation lacks, even though it is full of unconcealed, understandable meaning and I find this a really good thing for
a piece of art which intend to have a relationship with people.
