_dataviz off vs dataviz on_

--

#####What it is
>>_"How do we design familiar data visualisations to be beautiful,
to make data accessible but at the same time a joy to view?"_

That was the challenge. 

#####What it could mean
We are used to get dataviz on screens, often in motion, quite intricate, full of meanings. 
Let's try to put ourselves in a child's shoes: would it still be a useful visualisation? Understanding would become difficult. It would be simply not made for us. 
The risk could be to lose the will and the opportunity of understanding due to the "_increasing sophistication of data visualisations_". Any dataviz would become something to take a look at, superficially. We would be conscious that there is a bigger and proper meaning but deepening it would be too demanding so, we would probably just give up.
