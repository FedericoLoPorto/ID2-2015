#####What it is

Starting point:

>>_"How do we design familiar data visualisations to be beautiful,
to make data accessible but at the same time a joy to view?"_

David Sweeney - from Microsoft Research - tries to solve the question above designing _mechanically driven, physical charts to communicate data to people living or working on Tenison Road._ The kind of data in input are all about everyday life, as he said:

>>_"They switch between showing, one, vehicle journey data measured on the road, two, aggregated air quality measurements being recorded by residents, and, three, results from local polls and votes"._

Therefor, locals are part of the process of recording by using sensors along the road and polls throughout the neighbourhood. They are able to understand intuitively DataViz.

_dataviz off vs dataviz on_

The main trick is the use of _long established and highly familiar representations like pie charts and bar graphs_ as data representation.

>>_"The aim is not to be led by existing ideas, but to allow data to be made sense of and put to use over the course of the project"._

#####What it could mean

We are used to get dataviz on screens, often in motion, quite intricate, full of meanings. 
Let's try to put ourselves in a child's shoes: would it still be a useful visualisation? Understanding would become difficult. It would be simply not made for us. 
The risk could be to lose the will and the opportunity to understand due to the "_increasing sophistication of data visualisations_". Any dataviz would become something to take a look at, superficially. We would be conscious that there is a bigger and proper meaning but deepening it would be too demanding so, we would probably just give up.
I think everything is about one word: _beautiful_. What we define beautiful depends on who we are. David Sweeney says that beautiful means comprehensible.

#####How it works

_The pie charts are constructed around a unique 3D-printed helical guide (SLS nylon) which allows each slice to emerge from behind the front face. The stepper motors which drive each slice are mounted on bespoke mounts to acheive the required drive angle. The bar charts are made from an array of motor-controlled measuring tapes enveloped in coloured masking tape. A stepper motor meshes with each tape using a 3D-printed rubber wheel (Objet). All the physical charts are controlled using .NET Gadgeteer electronic devices and receive data over Wi-Fi from a central server based in the Azure cloud.

The use of materials such as paper and card, as well as familiar items such as DIY measuring tapes, was to add a sense of warmth and tactility to the data - encouraging the viewer to think about the stories which drive the visualisations. To ensure maximum clarity of the displayed data, the charts have been designed to be as visually similar to their 2D versions from which they were inspired. This requires that all the mechanics and control systems are hidden when viewing from the front._
