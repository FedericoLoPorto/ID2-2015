###Task and first considerations
The client has requested an art installation for the entrance hall of the university.
The entrance hall is, therefore, a space of introduction to inner parts of the building, the classrooms and labs, but in this case it could be the main theme, not only a place of through flow and redistribution of visitors, but it has the potential to be the place someone would love to spend his spare time during the break between classes. 
This space is a part of a building of the 16th century, renovated 15 years ago. This is relevant because there is no chance of intervention in hiding wires in dedicated places but they will be visible and the sound is amplified by the conditions, but mostly because walls are not squared at all, so special attention must be dedicated to these matters. 
Nowadays, this space is not evaluated as it can be because there lots of people passing by creating too much noise to concentrate to enjoy the magazines on the two tables and a good wifi connection and mobile signal miss.
Let's investigate what this space is and means.

###Composition
The space is articulated in two consequential rooms, one introducing the another in an obligated path from entrance to the stairs and elevator. Another path is from the entrance to the first stairs on the left which lead upstairs to the A classroom. 
The first room hosts the reception at right and a little hided space used as a showcase of students' works.
Then, we are introduced to the second room, which is the same dimensions of the first one not considering the ramp on the left. There are two wooden table on which lay design magazines of all kind. On the right wall, three info panels hang. An interesting thing is the low wall between this room and the ramp: it is a wooden cover bench, thought it is fascinating, it's not used.
Another info panel hangs on the wall near the corner before the ramp and a presentation panel on the final wall.

###Dimensions
The two rooms are both about 7.5 x 4.5 meters wide and 3.5-4 meters high.
 
###Light
Natural light is kind of missing in the first room: the only source is from the glass door and, indirectly, from the window on the stairs. 
The second room has a window near the left corner at a very high position and it gives daylight to all the space. 
Anyway, in both rooms, artificial light is always on. It comes from four rows of long neon lights in each room.

###Materials and chromatic palette
The most recurring colors are:
1- White/Light Cream: plaster on the walls
2- Black: skirting boards, handrail, energy sockets, neon lamps, fan coil upper grids
3- Brick Red: pavement tiles
4- Light wood: the wooden covered bench, most of the furnishing in the second room, the info panels
5- Natural stone: the wall behind the reception has four areas left in natural stone finishing, as the San Marino tradition.
6- Grey: the reception bar, the fan coils
7- Dark red: frame of the window in the second room

###Conclusion
The perfect installation site for its visibility would be on the wall at the very end of the second room.
Considering interactions with the users it not might be as perfect as it seemed. Under this light, a good place might be over the wooden covered bench and it would also create a division from the ramp and the room, giving the rrom the kind of concentration feeling it needs to be used for studying porpuse.
To enhance the room usability opportunities with the installation should be considered, because it would become a fundamental component in the room and not only the funnt trhing thing to play with the first three four times someone sees it.
